# java-card-game

I wanted to do a project in Java as an exercise and to have fun with OOP, so I 
made this project.

It's called `java-card-game` 'cause I wasn't sure what game to program at first.
Ultimately, I decided to do Blackjack, because I thought it would be relatively
simple. It wasn't.

This game is based on the casino game as described in the [Wikipedia 
page on Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). The exact rules
used by this program are explained in [rules.txt](./rules.txt).

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Betting hasn't been implemented in this program yet.
> 
> Gambling with real money will *never* be implemented in this program. There
> are other software for that.

## Running the program

The main class is (aptly named) `Main`.

Within the `./out/production/java-card-game/` directory, run `java Main`. This
assumes that you have Java installed and configured.
