# java-card-game

I wanted to do a project in Java as an exercise and to have fun with OOP, so I 
made this project.

It's called `java-card-game` 'cause I wasn't sure what game to program at first.
Ultimately, I decided to do Blackjack, because I thought it would be relatively
simple. It wasn't.

## Running the program

It's a barebones program and I haven't bothered packaging it or whatever.
