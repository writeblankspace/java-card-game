                                BLACKJACK

MAIN GOAL

The main goal of the game is to get a hand's value as close to 21 as possible
without going over ("busting"). Each hand starts with two cards. If the values
of these two initial cards add up to 21, that is called a "blackjack" and is the
most valuable hand.


CARD VALUES

Number cards are valued at their number (e.g. 2 of Spades has a value of 2).
Face cards are valued at 10 (e.g. Jack of Diamonds has a value of 10).

Aces are valued at 11 by default, unless this would result in a bust. In that
case, the ace is valued at 1.

Here are sample hands and their values:

╭────╮ ╭────╮ ╭────╮ ╭────╮
│♠  5│ │♥  A│ │♣  7│ │♦  J│
╭────╮ ╭────╮ ╭────╮ ╭────╮
│♥  3│ │♠  9│ │♣  6│ │♦  3│
│    │ │    │ ╭────╮ ╭────╮
╰────╯ ╰────╯ │♠  A│ │♦  5│
    8     20  │    │ │    │
              ╰────╯ ╰────╯
                 14     18


PLAYER OPTIONS

On the initial two cards, the player has up to five options: hit, stand, double
down, split and surrender.

Once a hand has more than two cards, only two options are available: hit and
stand.

    - HIT: take another card

    - STAND: take no more cards

    - DOUBLE DOWN: double the bet and take exactly one more card

    - SPLIT: if the two initial cards have the same value, split the hand into
        two. Each new hand gets a second card, resulting in two starting hands.
        The second hand requires an additional bet. The two hands are played out
        independently.

    - SURRENDER: forfeit half the bet and end the hand immediately


SPECIAL RULES FOR SPLITTING

A 10-valued card and an ace resulting from a split isn't considered a blackjack.

    - HIT: you can't hit split aces

    - SURRENDER: you can't surrender after splitting


AFTER THE PLAYERS HAVE FINISHED

After the players have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved.

The dealer draws cards until the hand achieves a total of 17 or higher. If the
dealer has a total of 17 including an ace valued as 11 (a "soft 17"), the dealer
continues drawing cards.

    - If the dealer busts, all players who haven't busted win.

    - If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher
        than the dealer's hand, as loses otherwise.

    - In the case of a tie, bets are returned without adjustment.

    - A blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack (even a hand with a
        value of 21).
